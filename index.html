<h1>It's Only April, But Yankees Have Proved They're Better Than The Last Few Teams</h1>

		<p>Think back to the start of the new year; it felt like all hope was lost for Major League Baseball and the Players’ Union to come to terms on a new labor deal in a timely manner. But, it’s the beginning of May and the MLB is just about thirteen percent of the way through the regular season.</p>

<p>To some Yankees fans, it may even be even more of a shock that the Pinstripes hold the league's best record thanks to a nine-game win streak to close out the month of April. This sounds like the same old song: Yankees start hot, convince everyone they’re a legitimate contender, then fall flat in the playoffs. But, the Yankees are off to a start that should turn the heads of even the most fervent haters.</p>

<p>Even in April, the goal is perform well in every facet of the game. Manager Aaron Boone said after the April 30th win over the Royals, that the Yankees are a complete team. Every metric that I could find indicates that the Yankees' skipper is speaking from the heart.</p>

<p>On offense, the “Bronx Bombers” have certainly earned that nickname. They're pacing the Majors in home runs, while also sitting third in the league in both slugging percentage and OPS.</p>

<p>At the same time, the pitching staff – which was criticized for a number of reasons – has put together one of the most remarkable starts of any rotation in recent history.</p>

<p><iframe title="The Yankees Don't Usually Pitch This Well" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-m7kkb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/m7kkb/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="401"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>

<p>There’s the ace of the staff, Gerrit Cole, whose unimpressive numbers seem to outshine two consecutive dominant starts to close out the month. The hard-throwing right-hander first shut down the Cleveland Guardians on April 24th, allowing zero runs over six-plus innings of work. Then, six days later, he earned his second win of the month by shutting out the Royals in six innings.</p>

<p>In fact, even if you take Cole out of the equation, the rest of the starting rotation is pitching to a 2.79 ERA, which would be the lowest in club history since the 1981 season.</p>

<p>This is a talented ball club, and it has been for a few years now. But, after a shocking exit in the 2021 AL Wild Card, the focus turned to the loaded free-agent class in the ensuing offseason.</p>

<p>There were household names on the market; however, these players came with a hefty price tag. Even with the supposed “deep pockets” of team owner Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees elected to go with cheaper options. Instead of dipping into a generational class of free-agent shortstops, New York brought in the young, unproven Isiah Kiner-Falefa to do the job. At first base, the Yankees could have signed former NL MVP Freddie Freeman to a long-term deal or traded minor-league prospects to Oakland for Gold-Glover Matt Olson, but they didn’t.</p>

<p>Despite questionable resumes, the new additions seem to be adjusting to their new home with ease. The aforementioned Kiner-Falefa is slashing a .303/.342/.379 (batting average/on-base percentage/slugging percentage) through the opening month with his new team. The Hawaiian native is also leading the team in doubles with only the sixth most at-bats.</p>

<p>Anthony Rizzo, who the Yankees signed to a two-year contract worth $32 million this offseason, is the full-time first baseman this season. The lefty-slugger is coming off of a couple of down years in 2020 and 2021. Now, whether or not the pandemic-shortened season in 2020 had any lingering effects on this two-year is unclear, but Rizzo certainly hasn’t been his usual self lately.</p>

<p>But, if the first month of the season is any indication of what lies ahead for the 2016 World Champion, then he’ll be in contention for an MVP award by season’s end. He has a 1.016 OPS, which is way above the league average, and leads the Major’s in home runs. Although initially cast aside as a “fallback” option for the Yankees back in the offseason, Rizzo has won over the hearts of the Bronx faithful.</p>

<p>Play like this could also be the jolt the Yankees need to get back to the postseason, and maybe even back to the World Series.</p>

<p>"Baseball is the single hardest thing to predict of all the things we forecast..." wrties FiveThirtyEight contributor Neil Paine on a Reddit thread this past week. "But what I like about the approach we take is that it's transparent -- you can download all our data and see where the numbers are coming from -- and it adapts over time, so we update our forecast constantly to hone in on a best guess for performance going forward.</p>

<p>FiveThirtyEight's most recent predictions echo the same sentiment Fangraphs does: the Yankees are one of the teams to beat this year. Now, it's a 162-game season and a lot can change from now to September. The way New York has won games thus far, however, is what makes a lot of people think something special is happening.</p>

<p>The opening series versus the Red Sox was close fought and emotional, but the Yankees still grinded out a series win over their arch-rivals. The next series against the Blue Jays, a formidable opponent and American League powerhouse, resulted in a series split. Starters Nestor Cortes Jr. and Luis Severino spun a couple of gems in games 2 and 4, combining for zero earned runs on five hits allowed.</p>

<p>However, these outings don’t hold a candle to the way New York has compiled wins over their nine-game winning streak. The offense and defense worked in perfect harmony to forge series sweeps over the Guardians, Orioles, and Royals, and all of that has led to a +39 run differential as a team.</p>

<p>The win against Baltimore may be the most crucial of all. It’s not like the O’s are a giant in the American League like the Blue Jays, in fact, they’re the exact opposite. Wins against the Orioles are expected of a team that wants to make a deep postseason run. Historically, they’ve actually helped decide the winner of the AL East:</p>

<p><iframe title="Want to win the AL East? You'll have to get through the Orioles first" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-nJROq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nJROq/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="444"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>

<p>The bottom line is, as much as it’s important to do well against good teams, it’s just as important to beat the teams you’re supposed to. With a 4-2 start against Baltimore in the early going, the Yankees have built themselves a good foundation in one of the league's best divisions.</p> 

<p>The Yankees now look ahead to a much tougher stretch in their schedule, with outings against the Blue Jays in 5 of their next 8 games. There are four games at the White Sox, the preseason favorites to win the AL Central, coming up in mid-May as well. Will it be a challenge to come out of these next 12 games with a winning record? Absolutely, but these Yankees seem to have the winning formula.</p>
